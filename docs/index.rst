Sugar Toolkit GTK4 Documentation
=================================

Welcome to the Sugar Toolkit GTK4 documentation. This is a GTK4 port of the Sugar Toolkit for Python activities, providing a modern framework for creating educational activities for the Sugar Learning Platform.

The Sugar Toolkit GTK4 provides Python developers with the tools needed to create interactive educational activities that run on Sugar OS and other platforms. This toolkit includes widgets, utilities, and frameworks specifically designed for creating engaging learning experiences.

Getting Started
===============

The Sugar Toolkit GTK4 is organized into several main modules:

* **sugar.activity** - Core activity framework and widgets
* **sugar.graphics** - UI components and styling
* **sugar.bundle** - Activity packaging and metadata
* **sugar.datastore** - Data persistence and sharing
* **sugar.presence** - Collaboration and networking
* **sugar.dispatch** - Event handling and signals
